# How to run the scraper
1. Running the scraper using proxy may not always work. The scraper run from particular location such as New York in this case. 

2. Running the scraper from the locations such Atlanta state and Las Vegas City were attempted and found to be failed

3. Running scraper from *New York* State seems to be working but we need to run it from the location New York and see if scraping is completed on the production environment. 

**NOTE**: The scraper must run from particular state such as most likely New York.
